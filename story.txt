This is a story about the end of the world. In 2020, a global pandemic struck down on the earth and wrecked havoc on everyone and everything. 
The world never recovered, even 40 years after the initial spread of this virus. It is now the year 2060, and I believe there are only days left. 
This might even be my last journal entry until all will be gone forever, lost in a sea of oblivion. I say this because the fires and earthquakes have not 
stopped for the past six months. There is only so much land to destroy until there is none left at all. California has already been lost to the great
hurricane five years ago. Hurricane Helene. It came out of the mist of the Pacific, gave no warning, before it crashed down at once from the North Coast
all the way to San Diego, destroying everything in its midst. Here in Wisconsin we are safe from the hurricanes, but the forecasters predict a great earthquake
that will break apart the land here, engulfing everything...maybe even me.

Fortunatly after all these years the rest of us kept struggling and trying to survive. People nearby gathered together and managed to build a small town for
the exchange of resources and the protection from these 'things' in the night. Yes, I wouldn't call thoses 'animals', they are too sophisticated to be called
animals. Last week they even get John with a booby trap! His leg... The mother natural did pushed her child to evolve, just not doing any favor for human now.

We always keep three men waking in the night, and the fence around town is useful so far, but the water is running low, the nearest pool is almost dry and the next
one is 50 miles away. Some of us have already been dehydrated today, we have to get some water tomorrow.

We had to get some water tomorrow...
